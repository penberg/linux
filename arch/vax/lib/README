This is pretty much all temporary. Stuff that isnt will need to be
rewritten.

# items lifted from linux tree
#  linux/lib/*.c 
#  	- headers hacked mercilessly until they compiled.
#	- asm-string.h is a stub (from linux/include/asm-alpha/string.h)
#	- printk is a chunk copied from linux/arch/alpha/boot/main.c
#	- stdarg.h is from gcc 2.7.2.3 
# 	- console.c is from the test vilo program.
